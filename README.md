Hello.


This is the LD57 submission of our team. Have a look, the programming behaviours in situations like game-jams are quite interesting.....

Due to github and my lack of experience, the contents of 'src/main/resources/assets' got expandet into the root, and all audio files weren't included. (thats due to the file-upload limitation of github on web)

If you want to, all resources are packaged into the binaries distributed at the LD-page https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/57/$408044
